		<h2>
			The Editor
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Editor consists of the main view on the left and the detail view on the right, which is only visible, if an object is selected in the main view.
			The main view shows all objects of the Entity-Relationship model.
			The detail view allows you to modify properties of one single object.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Creation of Entities
		</h2>
		<p>
			You can add an entity to the model by selecting the Model>New Entity menu, by double-clicking an empty area in the main editor or by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + E.
			The Entity will be added to the model and can be edited afterwards.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Creation of Relationships
		</h2>
		<p>
			You can add a Relationship to the model by selecting the Model>New Relationship menu, by double-clicking an Entity in the main editor or by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + R.
			For a Relationship, two Entities must be chosen, which will be connected by the new Relationship. This can be interrupted by pressing the ESC-key.
			After the Relationship was added to the model, it can be edited in the detail view.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Editing Entities
		</h2>
		<p>
			The detail view for editing an Entity can be opened by clicking on an Entity in the main view. The detail view allows you to specify a new name and to add attributes.
			Names for Entities, Relationships and Attributes have to be confirmed by pressing Backspace.
			To add a new Attribute, select New Attribute. The new Attribute appears in the Attribute list and can be renamed or set as a key attribute.
			Key attributes will be used to identify Entities or a Table row in a relational model.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Editing Relationships
		</h2>
		<p>
			To edit a Relationship, select it in the main view. The detail editor will show up, which will allow you to set the role of the Relationship
			and change the cardinality of it.
			<ul>
				<li>1:1 cardinality: Set the cardinality of both Entities to 1</li>
				<li>1:n cardinality: Set the cardinality of one Entity to n, the other to 1</li>
				<li>n:m cardinality: Set the cardinality of both Entities to n</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Weak Entities and Relationships
		</h2>
		<p>
			It is possible to make Entities and Relationships appear as weak. This makes them dependent on other Entities.
			Weak Entities and Relationships will be indicated by a double border. To make an Entity or Relationship appear as weak, select it in the main view and check the corresponding checkbox in the detail view.
			 Making an Entity or Relationship weak has no effect on the export as a relational model (see Export).
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Inheritance
		</h2>
		<p>
			An Entity type can inherit from another Entity type. This will add all attributes of the parent Entity to the child Entity.
			To activate inheritance, select an Entity and enable Inheritance in the detail view. An Entity, from which the inheritance should take place can then be specified.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Export
		</h2>
		<p>
			An ER-Model can be exported as an png-image or a relational model.
			To export an image, select the File>Export>As Image-Menu. The ER-Model will be rendered onto a png-image like it is shown in the editor. The image will be saved to disk.
			To export a relational model, select File>Export>As Relational Model. The ER-Model will be converted to a relational model, which shows all tables, which have to be created in a Database.
			Primary keys of a table are indicated with the prefix <code>pk_</code>. Foreign keys will be indicated with the prefix <code>fk_Entity1_RelationshipRole_Entity2_</code>.
